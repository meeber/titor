# Titor Functional Specification

## Backstory

In the year 2036, corporeal time-travel is added to the CERNScript specification, further widening the gap between the elite ruling class and the rest of the world's population who are still stuck using ECMAScript 5 due to browser compatibility concerns.

A rebel named John Titor, armed only with an IBM 5100, manages to hack CERN's database and steal the specification. With his newfound knowledge, Titor travels back in time to the year 2016.

His goal is singular: Prevent his dystopian future from becoming a reality by empowering developers to embrace ECMAScript 2015 and beyond.

## Overview

Titor is a Node.js package assistant.

The primary goal of Titor is to eliminate the barrier of entry for developing packages using the latest ECMAScript features. It accomplishes this goal by gluing together a bunch of proven libraries with some basic scripts.

Titor is very opinionated about which libraries you should use and how your project should be structured. It doesn't leave you much choice. This is intentional. Choice is great unless you're unknowledgeable, in a hurry, and/or prone to procrastination via tooling. Titor is from the future so it already knows what works. It'll make the unimportant decisions for you so that you can focus on what's important: what your project does.
