# Titor Functional Specification

## Backstory

In the year 2036, corporeal time-travel is added to the CERNScript specification, further widening the gap between the elite ruling class and the rest of the world's population who are still stuck using ECMAScript 5 due to browser compatibility concerns.

A rebel named John Titor, armed only with an IBM 5100, manages to hack CERN's database and steal the specification. With his newfound knowledge, Titor travels back in time to the year 2016.

His goal is singular: Prevent his dystopian future from becoming a reality by empowering developers to embrace ECMAScript 2015 and beyond.

## Overview

Titor is a Node.js package assistant.

The primary goal of Titor is to eliminate the barrier of entry for developing packages using the latest ECMAScript features. It accomplishes this goal by gluing together a bunch of proven libraries with some basic scripts.

Titor is very opinionated about which libraries you should use and how your project should be structured. It doesn't leave you much choice. This is intentional. Titor is from the future so it already knows what works. It'll make the unimportant decisions for you so that you can focus on what's important: what your project does.

## Scenarios

Steward is a fine programmer with a fresh idea for a library. Full of excitement, he sits down at his workstation, cracks his knuckles, and starts banging away at the keyboard. Several hours pass with little let up. From the outside, it appears that Steward is making great progress on his idea, but in reality he hasn't written a single line of code! The problem is that Steward is prone to procrastination via tooling. He spent the whole day messing around with libraries, writing build scripts, and tweaking the structure of his project directory. By the time he has to head out to Monday Pilates, all of his momentum is gone. If only Steward had used Titor, he could've started coding within minutes of sitting down, directing his energy where it actually matters.
